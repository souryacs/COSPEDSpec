Version 1.0
-----------

Basic implementation of COSPEDSpec
binary refinement of unresolves supertree using excess gene count information
absolute value of extra gene count measure is used for refinement

this implementation corresponds to the publication in ISBRA 2015

Version 2.0
-----------

Improved implementation of COSPEDSpec
here, normalized extra gene count (MNEGC criterion) is used for binary refinement
also we have modified newick string representation, DFS based parent assignment, etc.

this corresponds to the communicated manuscript in TCBB 2015


Version 3.0 
-------------

The algorithm is completely updated. Here, the supertree construction part is thoroughly modified, 
in order to apply couplet based relations selectively, between individual cluster pairs. The 
clusters are used to form a DAG, which subsequently generates the final supertree. The supertree 
is then refined, using our proposed novel excess gene leaf count measure (computed for individual couplets), 
to generate the final species tree.
