Version 1.0
-----------

Basic implementation of COSPEDSpec
binary refinement of unresolves supertree using excess gene count information
absolute value of extra gene count measure is used for refinement

this implementation corresponds to the publication in ISBRA 2015

Version 2.0
-----------

Improved implementation of COSPEDSpec
here, normalized extra gene count (MNEGC criterion) is used for binary refinement
also we have modified newick string representation, DFS based parent assignment, etc.

this corresponds to the communicated manuscript in TCBB 2015
