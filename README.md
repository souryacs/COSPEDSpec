COSPEDSpec
*********************************

COSPEDSpec is a python based tool for computing species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees:
1. First our earlier supertree method COSPEDTree is applied as its first stage, to generate a possibly non-binary species tree S' covering all the input taxa.
2. Subsequently we apply a refinement on S', with reducing the number of extra lineages (deep coalescence) with respect to the input gene tree set, for producing a strict binary species tree.


Input source trees can be either in NEWICK format or in NEXUS format. 
However, all the source trees should have identical input formats. They should be placed in a standard tree list file, according to the syntax of NEXUS or NEWICK formats. Such a tree list text file is to be provided as an input of this executable.

Output weighted supertree is generated in the NEWICK format.

*********************************
Dependencies
*********************************
COSPEDSpec is developed in Linux Systems (Ubuntu 14.04), using Python 2.7.

If a system alreay has python installed and the package has version lower than 2.7, then there can be problems, as tested. So, in such case, corresponding python package upgrade is requested.

The executable is tested with different versions of Ubuntu.
For systems having Ubuntu with lower versions, please notify in case of any errors. 

The executable does not require any libraries to be installed prior execution.

*********************************    
Execution 
*********************************

Upon extracting the archieve, one stand alone executable is found.
1. COSPEDSpec, which is the main executable of python script.

At first, change the permissions of the executables by first going into the directory containing this executable and then writing following commands:
chmod +x COSPEDSpec

The executable contains binaries of the source codes and the used libraries (static libraries).


*******************
EXAMPLE OF COMMANDS
*******************

./COSPEDSpec -I 'source_tree_input_filename' -p 'inp_file_format' -O 'out_species_tree'

  Command descriptions:

1. Using -I command we specify the input filename (denoted by 'source_tree_input_filename').   User need to specify the absolute or relative path of the file containing the input gene tree dataset (maintained in a text file of standard tree list, in either nexus or newick format).
2. -p option is for specifying the input tree format (as denoted by 'inp_file_format'). If input file contains the trees in NEWICK format, then specify the option as (-p 1) (1 stands for newick). If input file contains the trees in NEXUS format, then specify the option as (-p 2) (2 stands for nexus). By default, p = 1 is set.
3. -O option is required for specification of the output filename ('out_species_tree') containing the species tree. The tree will be stored in Newick format, and the output file will be a simple text file. In addition, one text file will be created in the same directory. It will contain the timing information.
