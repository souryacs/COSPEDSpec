COSPEDSpec
*********************************

COSPEDSpec is a python based tool for computing species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees:
1. First our earlier supertree method COSPEDTree is applied as its first stage, to generate a possibly non-binary species tree S' covering all the input taxa.
2. Subsequently we apply a refinement on S', with reducing the number of extra lineages (deep coalescence) with respect to the input gene tree set, for producing a strict binary species tree.


Input source trees can be either in NEWICK format or in NEXUS format. 
However, all the source trees should have identical input formats. They should be placed in a standard tree list file, according to the syntax of NEXUS or NEWICK formats. Such a tree list text file is to be provided as an input of this executable.

Output weighted supertree is generated in the NEWICK format.

*********************************
Dependencies
*********************************

COSPEDSpec is developed in Linux Systems (Ubuntu 14.04), using Python 2.7.

User needs to install following before using this package:

1) Python 2.7 (available in Ubuntu, by default) 

Note: We have not tested the code on Python 3. Any user having Python 3 environment need to check the correct execution of our code, and optionally needs to upgrade it accordingly.

We plan to support Python 3 environment in some future release.

2) Dendropy 3.12.0 ( available on the link: https://pythonhosted.org/DendroPy/ ) 

Note: there is a new release of Dendropy 4.0 but we have used 3.12.0 for the implementation. We did not upgrade the code for Dendropy 4.0 support, so any user having this new version of Dendropy might need to check the functionalities of COSPEDBTree and possibly upgrade / replace / edit few dendrop[y related functions. So, we recommend users to use the earlier version of Dendropy, to avoid any conflict.

Support for Dendropy 4 and corresponding update of code will be done in a future release.

3) Numpy ( available on the link: http://www.numpy.org/ )

User can install Numpy using pip (python software downloader tool) module, which contains the latest Numpy module in it. We found that Numpy module in the traditional Apt-Get repository is of lower version.

Command line options
****************

"-I", "--INPFILE"

          specifies name of the input file containing gene trees
			  
"-O", "--OUTFILE"

          specifies name of the output file to contain target species tree
  
"-p", "--inpform"
			  
        specifies the file format (input gene tree list containing file)
        its value can be 1 (corresponds to the newick format - default) or 2 (corresponding to the nexus format)


An example: 

./COSPEDSpec -I 'source_treelist.txt' -p1 -O 'out_species_tree.txt'
