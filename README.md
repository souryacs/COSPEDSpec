COSPEDSpec
*********************************

COSPEDSpec is a python based tool for computing species tree from a set of incongruent gene trees:
1. First our earlier supertree method COSPEDTree is applied as its first stage, to generate a possibly non-binary species tree S' covering all the input taxa.
2. Subsequently we apply a refinement on S', with reducing the number of extra lineages (deep coalescence) with respect to the input gene tree set, for producing a strict binary species tree.


Input source trees can be either in NEWICK format or in NEXUS format. 
However, all the source trees should have identical input formats. They should be placed in a standard tree list file, according to the syntax of NEXUS or NEWICK formats. Such a tree list text file is to be provided as an input of this executable.

Output weighted supertree is generated in the NEWICK format.

*********************************
Dependencies
*********************************

COSPEDSpec is developed in Linux Systems (Ubuntu 14.04), using Python 2.7.

User needs to install following before using this package:

1) Python 2.7 (available in Ubuntu, by default) 

Note: We have not tested the code on Python 3. 
Any user having Python 3 environment need to check the correct execution of our code, and optionally needs to upgrade it accordingly.

We plan to support Python 3 environment in some future release.

2) Dendropy 3.12.0 ( available on the link: https://pythonhosted.org/DendroPy/ ) 

Note: there is a new release of Dendropy 4.0 but we have used 3.12.0 for the implementation. We did not upgrade the code for Dendropy 4.0 support, so any user having this new version of Dendropy might need to check the functionalities of COSPEDBTree and possibly upgrade / replace / edit few dendrop[y related functions. So, we recommend users to use the earlier version of Dendropy, to avoid any conflict.

Support for Dendropy 4 and corresponding update of code will be done in a future release.

3) Numpy ( available on the link: http://www.numpy.org/ )

User can install Numpy using pip (python software downloader tool) module, which contains the latest Numpy module in it. We found that Numpy module in the traditional Apt-Get repository is of lower version.

*********************************    
Execution 
*********************************

Upon extracting the archieve, one stand alone executable is found.
1. COSPEDSpec, which is the main executable of python script.

At first, change the permissions of the executables by first going into the directory containing this executable and then writing following commands:
chmod +x COSPEDSpec

The executable contains binaries of the source codes and the used libraries (static libraries).


*******************
EXAMPLE OF COMMANDS
*******************

./COSPEDSpec -I 'source_tree_input_filename' -p 'inp_file_format' -O 'out_species_tree'

  Command descriptions:

1. Using -I command we specify the input filename (denoted by 'source_tree_input_filename').   User need to specify the absolute or relative path of the file containing the input gene tree dataset (maintained in a text file of standard tree list, in either nexus or newick format).
2. -p option is for specifying the input tree format (as denoted by 'inp_file_format'). If input file contains the trees in NEWICK format, then specify the option as (-p 1) (1 stands for newick). If input file contains the trees in NEXUS format, then specify the option as (-p 2) (2 stands for nexus). By default, p = 1 is set.
3. -O option is required for specification of the output filename ('out_species_tree') containing the species tree. The tree will be stored in Newick format, and the output file will be a simple text file. In addition, one text file will be created in the same directory. It will contain the timing information.
